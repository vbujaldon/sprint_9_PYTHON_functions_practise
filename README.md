# Python Exercises – Functions and Dictionaries
This repository contains a set of exercises developed in **Python** as part of the learning process in programming and basic data handling (SPRINT 9, IT ACADEMY OF BARCELONA ACTIVA).

The exercises are designed to **reinforce fundamental Python concepts**, with a particular focus on functions, control structures, dictionaries, and file handling.

## Repository contents

The exercises include, among others:

- Definition and use of **functions**
- User input validation using `try / except`
- Reading text files (`open`, `read`, `readlines`)
- Text cleaning and processing
- Counting elements using **dictionaries** and `collections.Counter`
- Data grouping and sorting
- Use of `lambda`, `sorted()`, and nested data structures
- Creation of main functions (`main`) to organize program flow

## Objective

The main goals of this repository are:

- To practice **proper code structure**
- To improve **reading and understanding Python programs**
- To apply basic best practices (helper functions, docstrings, modularity)
- To understand how dictionaries and collections work internally

## Level

📌 **Level:** beginner – intermediate  
📌 **Profile:** Python learners in an early learning stage

## Code structure

The programs follow a structure based on:
- Reusable helper functions
- A main function (`main`) that coordinates execution
- Explanatory docstrings to facilitate code comprehension

## Technologies used

- Python 3
- Standard libraries (`re`, `collections`)
